# -Resnet-Model

This talk was given at African Masterâ€™s of Machine Intelligence (AMMI-Ghana) during the Computer Vision Group meeting.

# Summary

Below is the summary of the the talk on the Resnet Model.

Very deep Neural Networks are difficult to train because of vanishing and exploding gradients problems.

Residual network also be know as skip connection.

Skip connection makes you take the activation from one layer and suddenly feed it to another layer even much deeper in Neural Network which allows you to train large NNs even with layers greater than 100.
